Through Eric Gentry Data Science LLC, I offer data science consulting and contract work, with services such as data visualization, modelling, statistcal analyses and data pipeline creation. Have an interesting project? Get in touch! I can be reached at EricGentry.DataScience@gmail.com, or any of my other email addresses.

It's a plus if you work in an interesting space or have an interesting application. Even if you're unsure, get in touch and we can chat. Broadly speaking, I'm passionate about fitness, the outdoors and projects that have a social good component.

Unfortunately I cannot offer any services too closely related to my primary job. This is handled on a case-by-case basis, but generally means I will not work on any application that tries to predict what products a consumer would find most interesting.
