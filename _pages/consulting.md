Through Eric Gentry Data Science LLC, I offer data science consulting and contract work. Have an interesting project? Get in touch! I can be reached at EricGentry.DataScience@gmail.com, or any of my other email addresses. Example services include data visualization, modelling, statistical analyses and data pipeline creation.

It's a plus if you work in an interesting space or have an interesting application. Broadly speaking, I'm passionate about fitness, the outdoors and projects that have a social good component.

Unfortunately I cannot offer any services too closely related to my primary job. This is handled on a case-by-case basis, but generally means I will not work on any application that tries to predict what products a consumer would find most interesting.
