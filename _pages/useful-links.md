This is partially for my own reference, partially for your reference if you find them useful.

# Machine Learning

Want a good overview for why certain components are commonly used in neural networks (e.g. dropout layers, data augmentation)? Check out [this paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf). It’s a mostly-entry level explanation.

Want a quick way to get started using neural networks in Python? Check out [keras](https://keras.io/).

# Python in Astronomy Demos

If you’ve never used Python before: [https://sites.google.com/site/lamatbootcamp2016/](https://sites.google.com/site/lamatbootcamp2016/)

If you want to learn more about Python, at UCSC we hold occasional discussion + demos of Python tools we use to be more productive. Our main repo of past discussions is [github/ucsc-astro/coffee](https://github.com/ucsc-astro/coffee). I’ve specifically talked about:


 - ipywidgets + Bokeh for interactive plots: [https://gist.github.com/egentry/deeb8f427be765e606c7](https://gist.github.com/egentry/deeb8f427be765e606c7)
 - [embarassingly] parallel programming: [https://github.com/egentry/AstroComputingSeminar_Parallel](https://github.com/egentry/AstroComputingSeminar_Parallel)

# Parallel Programming Basics


 - Using map in Python (embarrassingly parallelizable): [http://chriskiehl.com/article/parallelism-in-one-line/](http://chriskiehl.com/article/parallelism-in-one-line/)
 - Basic parallel computation in C: [https://www.gribblelab.org/CBootCamp/A2_Parallel_Programming_in_C.html](https://www.gribblelab.org/CBootCamp/A2_Parallel_Programming_in_C.html)


# Code misc.


 - I’ve found it helpful to follow [Jake VanderPlas’s blog](https://jakevdp.github.io/) (e.g. see his discussion on how to make “real” code run fast in Python: [https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2015/02/24/optimizing-python-with-numpy-and-numba/](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2015/02/24/optimizing-python-with-numpy-and-numba/))

# [Modern] Fortran

Previously I had to get up to speed in Modern Fortran. Since it's not a still-commonly-used language, here are the resources that were useful for learning it quickly:
- [https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/documents/13601/162125/fortran_class.pdf](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/documents/13601/162125/fortran_class.pdf)
- [http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/nmm1/fortran/paper_05.pdf](http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/nmm1/fortran/paper_05.pdf)

# Finding [Astronomy] Research papers

 - the [astrophysics data system](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/) (ADS)
 - [arXiv astro-ph](http://arxiv.org/archive/astro-ph)
 - [Vox Charta](http://voxcharta.org/)

# K-12 Teaching
- [Knowles Science Teaching Fellowship](http://www.kstf.org/) (substantial 5-year fellowship for new teachers, which can be used for teaching at any school)
- [Teaching Fellowship Programs (compiled by Oberlin)](https://www.oberlin.edu/career/go/gap-year/teaching-fellowships)
