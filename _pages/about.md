I'm a data and machine learning scientist at Microsoft, developing new ways to recommend online shopping products that a consumer might like. Previously I was an astronomer, receiving my PhD in May 2019 from UC Santa Cruz; before that I studied physics as an undergrad at MIT. During my summers in grad school I interned at [what is now] [Mission Lane](https://www.missionlane.com/) in 2017 and at [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/topics/datascience/?cdn=disable) in 2018.

During my first two years of grad school, I worked with Prof. [Mark Krumholz](http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~krumholz/), studying the [effects of supernovae explosions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01242). I continued that work with Prof. [Piero Madau](http://www.ucolick.org/~pmadau/Home.html), adding more complicated physics into our model ([magnetic fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06860), turbulence, gravity, etc.).

Near the end of grad school I also worked with Prof. [Alexie Leauthaud](https://alexie.sites.ucsc.edu/), using machine learning to identify low mass, low redshift galaxies in the [Hyper Suprime Cam survey](http://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/survey/). This was been a fun challenge of applying Deep Neural Networks to a >100 TB image dataset.

As an undergrad at MIT (2010-2014), I [used the Hubble Space Telescope](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04758), built [experimental X-ray telescopes and devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.4478), and worked with an international collaboration to [track how trace gases move through our atmosphere](https://www.atmos-meas-tech.net/10/4209/2017/).

Santa Cruz has been a great place to get outside the office. In my free time I [run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/8672659), [hike](https://flic.kr/s/aHskqdCtYF), [ski](https://flic.kr/s/aHskvmPBfb), [garden](https://flic.kr/s/aHskPp3iQm) and [take pictures](https://www.flickr.com/photos/egentry/).
