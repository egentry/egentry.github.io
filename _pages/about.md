I'm an applied scientist at Amazon, using machine learning to create new ways to connect brands and online shoppers.  Previously I was a data and applied scientist at Microsoft where I built product recommendation systems for online shoppers. Before moving into the machine learning world, I was an astronomer, receiving my PhD from UC Santa Cruz in May 2019 and as an undergrad I studied physics at MIT.

During my first two years of grad school, I worked with Prof. [Mark Krumholz](http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~krumholz/), studying the [effects of supernovae explosions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01242). I continued that work with Prof. [Piero Madau](http://www.ucolick.org/~pmadau/Home.html), adding more complicated physics into our model ([magnetic fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06860), turbulence, gravity, etc.).

Near the end of grad school I also worked with Prof. [Alexie Leauthaud](https://alexie.sites.ucsc.edu/), using machine learning to identify low mass, low redshift galaxies in the [Hyper Suprime Cam survey](http://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/survey/). This was been a fun challenge of applying Deep Neural Networks to a >100 TB image dataset.

As an undergrad at MIT (2010-2014), I [used the Hubble Space Telescope](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04758), built [experimental X-ray telescopes and devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.4478), and worked with an international collaboration to [track how trace gases move through our atmosphere](https://www.atmos-meas-tech.net/10/4209/2017/).

When I'm not working on these projects, I love getting outdoors. In my free time I [run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/8672659), [hike](https://flic.kr/s/aHskqdCtYF), [ski](https://flic.kr/s/aHskvmPBfb), [garden](https://flic.kr/s/aHskPp3iQm) and [take pictures](https://www.flickr.com/photos/egentry/).
