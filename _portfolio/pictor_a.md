Using Hubble Space Telescope data of the FRII radio galaxy Pictor A, I studied the megaparsec scale jet coming from the Active Galactic Nucleus.  Combining my optical data with radio and X-ray data from others, I could definitely rule out a "boosted IC-CMB" (inverse compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background) classification to its spectral energy distribution.  This suggests the observed X-ray emission is due to synchrotron emission, not IC-CMB emission.

As part of this work I [published a paper in the Astrophysical Journal](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04758), gave a talk at the 2014 Northeast Regional Quasar and AGN Meeting at Harvard (NERQUAM), wrote a senior thesis and presented a poster at the Winter 2014 AAS conference.

Comparison of the jet across optical bands. The view using the F160 filter shows a previously-unknown optical counterpart to the known X-ray jet (shown by green contours):
