This was the bulk of my PhD thesis. Basically we still do not know how strong the explosions from SN should be when the shock waves from multiple SNe explode. In our first paper we showed it might have a significant impact, and in our second paper we showed that the true impact depends sensitively on how much energy and mass is able to mix across the shock wave, but that modern simulations cannot yet measure this.
