Calibrated an X-ray machine using radiometric film. Provided rough calibration for X-rays used in testing fusion components, and also as a proof-of-concept for the use of radiometric films in plasma experiments.

Also drafted and built numerous X-ray calibration and accelerator component parts.

An example of exposed radiometric film that is only sensitive to X-rays:
