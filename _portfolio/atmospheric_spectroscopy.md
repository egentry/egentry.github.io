Installed a 3 band (UV, VIS, IR) remote sensing spectrometer on a research jet, for measuring concentration of atmospheric gases. Operated spectrometer during German national research campaign.  Developed software for calibrating data.

Resulting paper: [The novel HALO mini-DOAS instrument: inferring trace gas concentrations from airborne UV/visible limb spectroscopy under all skies using the scaling method](https://www.atmos-meas-tech.net/10/4209/2017/)
