We had a roughly 18m-long beamline for testing an experimental x-ray polarimetry technique, but we had to align it first.  I spent some time aligning the system, then collecting the data which we would later [publish at an SPIE (optics) conference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.4478).

Developing a laser alignment procedure for our 18 meter x-ray beamline:

Experimental verification of our approach's ability to measure polarized x-rays. (The fitted model is what is expected when a linearly polarized source is at an angle relative to polarization-sensetive mirror)
