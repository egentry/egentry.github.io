My most recent paper has been submitted to MNRAS and is now up on the arXiv:

[https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06860](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06860)

Previous simulations studying clustered SNe had given results that differ by as much as an order or magnitude. In this paper, we try to understand the source of those differences, by running new simulations that “bridge the gaps” between the simulations used for previous papers.  Now we better understand the source of these differences, but the "true" strength of clustered SN feedback is still uncertain by an order of magnitude.
