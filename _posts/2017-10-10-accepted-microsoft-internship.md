I'm excited to say that I'll be in Bellevue, WA this summer, working at Microsoft as a Data Science Intern.

 
I'll be in town June 18 â€“ Sept 7. Let me know if you're in the area and want to chat!

I also look forward to getting in a bunch of running, biking and swimming. My current plan is to do my first triathlon when I'm up there.
