The first quarter is over, my time as a Teaching Assistant has come to a close, so now it's time to focus more on my research. With that has come a change in projects.

I've begun working with [Mark Krumholz](http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~krumholz/), doing 1D hydro simulations.  With this new project comes the opportunity to learn much more about numerical methods for astro-fluids and parallelization (as well as learning some Fortran).  As I'm working on this project, I'll also be taking a Computational Fluid Dynamics course at UCSC, which should complement this research well.

Exciting times, starting work on a computational astrophysics project!
